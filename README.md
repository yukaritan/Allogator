I had a very simple idea, and I wrote a very simple program to test it out; this is a little toy implementation of SQL style transactions in C++.

Warning: horribly inefficient code ahead, remember to wear a helmet.

Other warning: I used  UpperCamelCase for functions and lowerCamelCase for variables.

Yet another warning: I put { on a separate line, and I use braces very consequently.

If any of this this triggers your autism, too bad.
